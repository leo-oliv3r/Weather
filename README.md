# Quick Weather

I've learned a lot building this project. It was made with Vite, Typescript, Scss and the [Weather Api](https://www.weatherapi.com/). No frameworks.
Learned how to better organize the code into components. How to use the BEM naming convention and overall and i feel i leveled up my coding skills. 

Exciting stuff 😁
